# Hi,

I am an **R&D Scientist** and PhD Candidate in Data Visualization at PUC-Rio.  
My work combines **human–data interaction, data visualization, data science, and human–computer interaction** to design and evaluate interactive systems that help people make sense of data.  

I mainly work with JavaScript (React) and Python (Flask, Django), using Vega and D3 to build data-driven applications.
